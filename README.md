Git collaboratin notes

-'git clone <url>': downloads the repository from the web to your local computer
	- make sure you dont nest this command into another repository
	- just like 'git init', only do this once per repo

- 'git branch <branch_nbame>': create a new branch where HEAD is
	- 'git branch -a': list all the branches your local machine knows of
- 'git swithc <branch_name>': move to branch
	- 'git checkout <branch_name>': the pre-august 2019 way
